## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TuckerTucker/TaskBoardAI.git
cd TaskBoardAI
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Starting a Local Board

1. List available boards:
```bash
./_start_kanban --list
```

2. Create a new board:
```bash
./_start_kanban --new my-project
```

3. Open an existing board:
```bash
./_start_kanban my-project
```

4. Access your board at `http://localhost:3001` (default port)

### Running Tests

1. Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

2. Generate coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

3. Run tests in watch mode (for development):
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

4. Run specific test categories:
```bash
# Run MCP server tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern 'tests/.*mcp'

# Run only unit tests
npm test -- tests/unit

# Run only integration tests
npm test -- tests/integration
```

### Using an External Board Location
_*not yet supported via MCP_

1. Create a new board directory anywhere on your system
2. Copy the example board:
```bash
cp /path/to/TaskBoardAI/boards/_kanban_example.json /your/board/location/board_name.json
```

3. Start the server with your external board location:
```bash
./_start_kanban --external /your/board/location/board_name.json
```

## Board Structure

The kanban board is defined in a JSON file with the following structure:
This allows the Agent to have full context of the project

```json
{
  "projectName": "Project Name",
  "columns": [
    {
      "id": "column-id",
      "name": "Column Name",
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "card-id",
          "title": "Card Title",
          "content": "Markdown supported content",
          "collapsed": false,
          "subtasks": [
            "âœ“ Completed task",
            "Pending task"
          ],
          "tags": ["feature", "frontend"],
          "dependencies": ["other-card-id"],
          "completed_at": "2025-01-19T18:12:35.604Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "next-steps": [
    "Next priority task",
    "Future focus area"
  ],
  "last_updated": "2025-01-19T19:20:14.802Z"
}
```

## MCP Server for AI Integration
_[What Is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)_ </br>
TaskBoardAI includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows you to create and manage boards using any tools supporting MCP (i.e. Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf ... ). 

### Starting the MCP Server

Start just the MCP server:
```bash
./_start_mcp
```

Or start both the Kanban board and MCP server together:
```bash
./_start_all
```


### Using with Agents

Once configured, you can ask the agent to:
- List all boards: "Show me all my kanban boards"
- Create a new board: "Create a new kanban board called 'Project X'"
- Get a specific board by ID: "Show me the details of board with ID [board-id]"
- Get a specific board by Name: "Show me the details of Project X"
- Update a board: "Update the Project X board with our progress"
- Delete a board: "Delete the Project X board"

## Webhook Integration

TaskBoardAI supports webhooks for integrating with other services:

1. Create webhook configurations to trigger on events like board updates
2. Test webhook connections through the API
3. Receive real-time updates when changes occur on your boards
