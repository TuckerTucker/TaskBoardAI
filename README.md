**Note** <br>
TaskBoardAI doesn't have it's own llm integration. <br>

## Installation

### Option 1: Install via npm (Recommended)

Install globally for command-line access from anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g taskboardai
```

Or install locally in your project:

```bash
npm install taskboardai
```

### Option 2: Clone the Repository (Development)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TuckerTucker/TaskBoardAI.git
cd TaskBoardAI
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Using npm-installed Version

When installed globally via npm, you can use the following commands:

1. List available boards:
```bash
taskboard --list
```

2. Create a new board:
```bash
taskboard --new my-project
```

3. Open an existing board:
```bash
taskboard my-project
```

4. Start the MCP server:
```bash
taskboard-mcp
```

5. Start both the board server and MCP server:
```bash
taskboard-all
```

### Using Repository Version

If you've cloned the repository, use the included scripts:

1. List available boards:
```bash
./_start_kanban --list
```

2. Create a new board:
```bash
./_start_kanban --new my-project
```

3. Open an existing board:
```bash
./_start_kanban my-project
```

4. Access your board at `http://localhost:3001` (default port)

### Using an External Board Location
_*not yet supported via MCP_

1. Create a new board directory in your project's repo
2. Copy the example board:
   
   If installed via npm:
   ```bash
   # First, create an example board in your home directory
   taskboard --new example
   
   # Then copy it to your desired location
   cp ~/.taskboardai/boards/example.json /your/board/location/board_name.json
   ```
   
   If using the repository:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/TaskBoardAI/boards/_kanban_example.json /your/board/location/board_name.json
   ```

3. Start the server with your external board location:
   
   If installed via npm:
   ```bash
   taskboard --external /your/board/location/board_name.json
   ```
   
   If using the repository:
   ```bash
   ./_start_kanban --external /your/board/location/board_name.json
   ```

## Board Structure

The kanban board is defined in a JSON file with the following structure:
This allows the Agent to have full context of the project

```json
{
  "projectName": "Project Name",
  "id": "unique-board-id",
  "columns": [
    {
      "id": "column-id",
      "name": "Column Name"
    }
  ],
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": "card-id",
      "title": "Card Title",
      "content": "Markdown supported content",
      "columnId": "column-id",
      "position": 0,
      "collapsed": false,
      "subtasks": [
        "âœ“ Completed task",
        "Pending task"
      ],
      "tags": ["feature", "frontend"],
      "dependencies": ["other-card-id"],
      "created_at": "2025-01-18T10:00:00.000Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-01-19T12:30:00.000Z",
      "completed_at": "2025-01-19T18:12:35.604Z"
    }
  ],
  "next-steps": [
    "Next priority task",
    "Future focus area"
  ],
  "last_updated": "2025-01-19T19:20:14.802Z"
}
```

> Note: The board structure has been updated to a card-first architecture, where cards are stored in a top-level array rather than nested within columns.

## MCP Server for AI Integration
_[What Is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)_ </br>
TaskBoardAI includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows you to create and manage boards using any tools supporting MCP (i.e. Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf ... ). 

### Starting the MCP Server

If installed via npm:
```bash
# Start only the MCP server
taskboard-mcp

# Or start both the board server and MCP server
taskboard-all
```

If using the repository:
```bash
# Start only the MCP server
./_start_mcp

# Or start both servers
./_start_all
```

The MCP server runs on port 3002 by default.

See the documentation for your IDE or CLI tool on how to add MCP servers.

### Using with Agents

Once configured, you can ask the agent to:
- List all boards: "Show me all my kanban boards"
- Create a new board: "Create a new kanban board called 'Project X'"
- Get a specific board by Name: "Show me the details of Project X"
- Update a board: "Update the Project X board with our progress"
- Delete a board: "Delete the Project X board"

## Webhook Integration

TaskBoardAI supports webhooks for integrating with other services:

1. Create webhook configurations to trigger on events like board updates
2. Test webhook connections through the API
3. Receive real-time updates when changes occur on your boards

## Running Tests

1. Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

2. Generate coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

3. Run tests in watch mode (for development):
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

4. Run specific test categories:
```bash
# Run MCP server tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern 'tests/.*mcp'

# Run only unit tests
npm test -- tests/unit

# Run only integration tests
npm test -- tests/integration
```

## Generating Docs

To generate documentation:
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
npm install

# Generate docs (docs/api directory)
npm run docs
```


## Data Directory

When installed via npm, TaskBoardAI stores user data in the following location:

- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.taskboardai/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.taskboardai\`

The data directory contains:

- `boards/`: Your kanban board JSON files
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `webhooks/`: Webhook configurations

You can access or back up these files directly if needed.
