```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

3. Run tests in watch mode (for development):
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

4. Run specific test categories:
```bash
# Run MCP server tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern 'tests/.*mcp'

# Run only unit tests
npm test -- tests/unit

# Run only integration tests
npm test -- tests/integration
```

### Using an External Board Location

1. Create a new board directory anywhere on your system
2. Copy the example board:
```bash
cp /path/to/TaskBoardAI/boards/_kanban_example.json /your/board/location/board_name.json
```

3. Start the server with your external board location:
```bash
./_start_kanban --external /your/board/location/board_name.json
```

## Board Structure

The kanban board is defined in a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "projectName": "Project Name",
  "columns": [
    {
      "id": "column-id",
      "name": "Column Name",
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "card-id",
          "title": "Card Title",
          "content": "Markdown supported content",
          "collapsed": false,
          "subtasks": [
            "âœ“ Completed task",
            "Pending task"
          ],
          "tags": ["feature", "frontend"],
          "dependencies": ["other-card-id"],
          "completed_at": "2025-01-19T18:12:35.604Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "next-steps": [
    "Next priority task",
    "Future focus area"
  ],
  "last_updated": "2025-01-19T19:20:14.802Z"
}
```

## MCP Server for AI Integration

TaskBoardAI includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows you to create and manage boards using Claude for Desktop. The MCP server has comprehensive test coverage including unit tests for individual tools and integration tests for full workflows.

### Starting the MCP Server

Start just the MCP server:
```bash
./_start_mcp
```

Or start both the Kanban board and MCP server together:
```bash
./_start_all
```

### Configure Claude for Desktop

1. Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following configuration (adjust the path to match your system):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kanban": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/TaskBoardAI/server/mcp/kanbanMcpServer.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude for Desktop

### Using with Claude

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:
- Create a new board: "Create a new kanban board called 'Project X'"
- List all boards: "Show me all my kanban boards"
- Get a specific board: "Show me the details of board with ID [board-id]"
- Update a board: "Update this board with the following data: [board data in JSON format]"
- Delete a board: "Delete the board with ID [board-id]"

## Webhook Integration

TaskBoardAI supports webhooks for integrating with other services:

1. Create webhook configurations to trigger on events like board updates
2. Test webhook connections through the API
3. Receive real-time updates when changes occur on your boards

## Customization

- Modify board columns and structure through the Settings panel
- Customize UI theme in the configuration
- Add custom tags and card templates
