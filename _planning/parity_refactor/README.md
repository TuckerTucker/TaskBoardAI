# TaskBoardAI Refactoring Plan

This directory contains the detailed implementation plan for refactoring TaskBoardAI to achieve feature parity and consistency across all interfaces (MCP, REST API, and CLI).

## Implementation Order

1. [TypeScript Setup](01-typescript-setup.md)
2. [Core Schema Definitions](02-core-schema-definitions.md)
3. [Repository Layer](03-repository-layer.md)
4. [Service Layer Foundation](04-service-layer.md)
5. [Error Handling System](05-error-handling.md)
6. [MCP Interface Refactoring](06-mcp-interface.md)
7. [REST API Enhancements](07-rest-api.md)
8. [CLI Redesign](08-cli-redesign.md)
9. [Query Capabilities](09-query-capabilities.md)
10. [Template System Upgrades](10-template-system.md)
11. [Batch Operations](11-batch-operations.md)
12. [Authentication & Security](12-authentication-security.md)
13. [Observability & Telemetry](13-observability.md)
14. [Workflow Capabilities](14-workflow-capabilities.md)
15. [Developer Experience Tools](15-developer-tools.md)

## Implementation Strategy

This refactoring plan focuses on achieving:

1. **Unified Architecture**: A service-oriented design with a clear separation of concerns
2. **Feature Parity**: Ensuring all interfaces provide consistent functionality
3. **TypeScript Integration**: Adding static typing throughout the codebase
4. **Improved Agent Interaction**: Making the system more useful for AI agents
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Better CLI, API responses, and documentation

## Getting Started

1. Create a new branch from `main`: `git checkout -b refactor/unified-architecture`
2. Follow the implementation order defined above
3. Each step is designed to be independently testable while building toward the complete refactoring

## Testing Strategy

Each implementation step includes test expectations to ensure functionality is maintained throughout the refactoring process. The focus is on:

1. Unit tests for core services and repositories
2. Integration tests for interfaces
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Future Considerations

While this plan is comprehensive, certain aspects may be expanded based on requirements that emerge during implementation, particularly around:

1. Multi-user collaboration features
2. Cloud integration options
3. Mobile app support
4. External integrations
